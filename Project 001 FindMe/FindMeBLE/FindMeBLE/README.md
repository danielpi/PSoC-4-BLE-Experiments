## Find Me BLE for Mac OS X

A little project to interact with an embedded BLE device that is programmed with the Find Me Profile.

So what does this program need to do?
- Search for nearby devices that are advertising that they are in Find Me mode.
- Connect to a selected component
- Adjust the alert level
- Maybe display the signal strength
